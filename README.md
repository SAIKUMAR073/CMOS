## Project
### Design of Timer555 in Astable Mode Confriguation
-->The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit (chip) used in a variety of timer, delay, pulse generation, and oscillator applications.The basic 555 timer gets its name from the fact that there are three internally connected 5Kohm resistors which it uses to generate the two comparators reference voltages.
-->This Repository Consists of\ 
#### NgSpice Code file
-->This is a NgSpice Code where the code is written for the circuit in NgSpice Software.
#### Output
-->The Output after the exceution of NgSpice Code.
#### Microwind Layout
-->The layout of Timer555 in the Astable Confrigution was created in Microwind Software.
